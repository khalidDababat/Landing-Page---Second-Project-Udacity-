                  persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 
                  During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in</p>
                 <p> India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List 
                 since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully ></p>
